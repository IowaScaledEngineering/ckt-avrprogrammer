SOFTWARE
-----------------------------------
The firmware in the pocket-prog directory originally came from Sparkfun's
Pocket AVR Programmer project on GitHub:

https://github.com/sparkfun/Pocket_AVR_Programmer

This was, in turn, based on the USBtiny by Dick Streefland, and USBtinyISP
by Limor Fried.
